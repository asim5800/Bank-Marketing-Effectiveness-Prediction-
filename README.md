# Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction-

## Problem Statement
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
The dataset consists of direct marketing campaigns data of a banking institution which consisted of 45211 data points with 17 independent variables out of which 7 were numeric features and 10 were categorical features.


## Approach
Performed exploratory data analysis with to get insights from the data to observe following things:-

1. The dataset was imbalanced, where the number of negative classes is close to 8 times the number of positive classes.
2. The customers who had a job of admin had the highest rate of subscribing a term deposit, but they were also the highest when it comes to not subscribing. This is simply because we have more customers working as admin than any other profession.
3. Majority of the customers were married. Followed by Single, divorced and unknown.
4. Majority of the customers had a housing loan.
